## Inspiration
Add your Team’s Inspiration for the Chatbot

This was inspired by the recent pandemic that caused many industries to be disrupted.

## What it does
Add a short description


## List your Chatbot’s features and use cases
1. 1 Check if the business is full and then tells the user if its a good time to come in
1. 2 The user wants to get an alert when the business is emptpy and they can get through quickly


## How we built it
Tech Stack & Documentation:
* 1 Express.js
* 2 Heroku
* 3 HTML
* 4 Javascript


## Challenges we ran into
1. We had to remove a usecase since there was an issue with time to implement it
 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Learning to deploy an application for testing purposes on the cloud
* We learned how to collaborate on testing and adjusting features in real time with a version-control system


## What we learned
* Git branching and merging


## What's next for “TimeSaver”
Product Roadmap - next features for example
1. Implement a remote queueing feature so when persons come in they can reserve their space leave and be notified with its close to their time to get served
1. Feature 2


## Built With - provide the tech stack used
