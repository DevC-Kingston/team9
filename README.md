## Inspiration

This was inspired by the recent pandemic that caused many industries to be disrupted. The pandemic has made waiting in line and large gatherings more difficult, restricted and complex as they are restrictions on the ammount of people that are allowed in buildings at a time. Some individuals have to wait outside for another person to leave before they can enter.

## What it does
The bot allows users to schedule the time they want to come in, figure out if the business is at capacity and also give the user a little information about the business.


## List your Chatbot’s features and use cases
1. 1 Check if the business is full and then tells the user if its a good time to come in
1. 2 The user wants to get an alert when the business is emptpy and they can get through quickly
